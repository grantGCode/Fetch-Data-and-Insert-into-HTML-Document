Instructions:
Start by creating a new HTML file and a corresponding JavaScript file.
In the HTML file, create a simple structure with a <div> element where you will insert the fetched
data.

In your JavaScript file, use the Fetch API to retrieve data from the following API endpoint:
'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1'.

The response from the API will be a JSON object with this structure:

{ "userId": 1, "id": 1, "title": "delectus aut autem", "completed": false }


Parse the fetched data and interpolate it into your HTML file. For each key-value pair in the
data, create a new paragraph (<p>) with the content being the key and value.
